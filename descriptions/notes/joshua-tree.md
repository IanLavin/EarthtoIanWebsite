## Notes
- The park is actually composed of two deserts, the Mojave desert and the Colorado Desert.
- The large smooth boulders and rock faces scattered throughout the park make it quite popular for rock climbers.
- The name Joshua Tree comes from Mormon colonists who believed the shaggy trees resembled a bearded Joshua with his hands up beckoning them through the desert.
