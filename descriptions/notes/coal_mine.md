- While in the pass a permit from the Navajo nation was required to visit as of last year this was no longer the case.
- The canyons name comes from the thin black layer of low grade coal visible near the top of the canyon rim.
- This area is completly undeveloped and if visiting there is a high chance you will be the only one around. Be prepared and a 4 wheel drive car is reccomended for the final stretch.
- Be aware the edge of the canyon is very weak and often can overhang sheer drop off. Be aware and dont get too close as you never know if an edge will give way.
