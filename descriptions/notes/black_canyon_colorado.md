- The black canyon is a long region with many things to discover within it. While many can be accessed by hiking, the best way is to spend a full day kayaking down the Colorado River 
- The kayak path is 12 miles and will often take a full day 8 hours to traverse.
- Some major highlights along the way include Arizona Hot Springs and Gold Strike Hot Springs.
- Emerald cave is the most well known of the sights along the path. When visited at the right time of day it glows a bright green color. The proper time of day depends on when you visit during the year but generally falls between 1-4pm.
