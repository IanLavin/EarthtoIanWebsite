## Notes
- At one point Mt Elbert was involved in a dispute over its neighbor Mt Massive, a mere 12 feet shorter. Supporters of Massive felt it was more worthy of being the tallest and started stacking rocks on its summit to surpass Elbert, only for Elbert supporters to begin demolishing their stacks.
- A jeep was once driven to the summit in 1949.
- Despite its status as the tallest of the Rocky Mountains, its mild slopes earned it the nickname the gentle giant.
