## Notes
- Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world due to its high likelyhood to errupt in the future and close proximity to major urban areas.
- Due to its snow covered peak, the summit elevation has actually been decreasing due to climate change, dropping nearly 20 feet in 20 years.
- The peak is the most heavily glaciated in the contiguous United States.
