## Notes
- From the top of the peak, on the clearest of days nearly 25% of the state of Arizona can be seen.
- The group of summits are actually the remnants of an eroded volcanic rim, with the volcanos previous high estimated to be between 15,000 - 16,000 feet.
- The peaks are also the site of the most popular ski resort in Arizona, Snowbowl, where the trail to the summit begins.
