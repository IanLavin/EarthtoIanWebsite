## Notes
- Despite having hill in the name, the point is no more than 30 feet higher than the surrounding landscape.
- A.H Marshall was the first to complete all 50 US state highpoints with hoosier hill as his final one in 1936
- There used to be a sign for the highpoint, but it was frequently stolen, leading to the current engraved boulder, which is much harder to steal.
