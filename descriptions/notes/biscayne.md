- Biscayne is unique in that unlike nearly every other national park most of it lies beneath the water.
- This means that to truly expereince the park you will need to get on/in the water.
- Snorkeling especially is the best way to experience the park.
- While snorkeling through mangroves is decent, the best location by far is the Mandalay wreck, a shallow water shipwreck.
- Due to its location far from the coast access is often unavailable, but if you luck out and visit on a day where access is possible it provides amazing views.
