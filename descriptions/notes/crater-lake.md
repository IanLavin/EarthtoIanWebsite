## Notes
- Crater lake is the deepest lake in the United States. It is the filled cauldera of a collapsed volcano.
- As a result of its higher elevation snow can remain into June and sometimes even July depending on the year.
- While swimming in the lake is normally allowed, the trail down has been closed and will not reopen until 2029.
