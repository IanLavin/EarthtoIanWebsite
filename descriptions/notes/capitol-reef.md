- The park contains a nearly 100 mile long ridge of rock known as the Waterpocket Fold.
- The parks name comes from the white Navajo sandstone cliffs with dome formations scattered throughout the park, simlar to those seen on capitol buildings.
- The rugged ridges from the fold were referred to by early settles as reefs, giving the park the second part of its name.
