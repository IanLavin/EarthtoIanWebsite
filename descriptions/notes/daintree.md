## Notes
- Daintree is the oldest continuous rainforest on earth, stretching back over 180 million years.
- It is the only place in the world where two world heritage sites meet, as it runs parallel to the Great Barrier Reef.
- Although rare to spot, the rainforest is home to Cassowaries, massive birds known to be some of the most dangerous in the world.
