## Notes
- The nearby Colorado river would frequently change course and form shallow temporary lakes filled with sediment. When the river would eventually divert these lakes would dry and sediment would remain and be swept up by the wind, forming the dunes.
- Their close proximity to Los Angeles has made the dunes popular for filmaking, with their most famous instance being Tatooine in Return of the Jedi.
- The dunes are quite popular for off road vehicles during the winter months.
- Parts of the dunes actually extend across the border into Mexico
