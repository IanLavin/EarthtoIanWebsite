## Notes
- The brilliant blue green colors of the lakes are due to suspended rock flour within the water.
- This trail is one of the most popular in all of Colorado, and for good reason.
- There is a hidden little known waterfall near the trailhead. From South Mineral Campground head southwest along south fork of mineral creek back about half a mile to find it.
