- Fossil Creek is one of two wild and scenic rivers in Arizona and is formed from a series of springs pumping out 20,000 gallons of water per minute.
- The water stays at a consistent 72 degrees throughout the year, making it quite plesant for swimming.
- Calcium carbonate distilled within the water precipitates out and forms numerous travertine dams along its course.
