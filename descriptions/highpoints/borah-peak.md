Borah Peak is Idaho’s highest point, rising sharply from the Lost River Range and offering a true high-alpine experience. The standard route features steady climbing and the famous Chickenout Ridge, a short but exposed scramble that adds excitement without technical climbing. From the summit, wide-open views stretch across some of the most rugged and remote terrain in central Idaho.
