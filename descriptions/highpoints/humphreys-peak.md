Humphreys Peak is the highest point in Arizona, rising above the San Francisco Peaks just north of Flagstaff. The climb offers a surprising alpine feel for the Southwest, with dense forests at lower elevations giving way to tundra-like terrain near the summit. On clear days, the views stretch across northern Arizona, revealing volcanic landscapes, desert plains, and distant mountain ranges.
