## Getting there
- Closest airport: Portland is the closest but Seattle Tacoma can work as well. Both are a few hours drive away.
- Drive time: 3-5 hours depending on which airport chosen. 4x4 vehicle with high clearance reccomend for reaching Cold Springs Campground.
- Trailhead / entry point: Majority of climbs start from south trailhead in Cold Springs Campground. Accessable via a steep rough dirt road. Overnight camping is recommended for early morning start.

## Time & season
- Best months: Peak season is June-Aug. Before this window the road to Cold Springs will likely not be snow free, while after this the climb transforms into an unplesant slog up thousands of feet of scree.
- Typical start time: Alpine start recommended. Generally between 3-5am depending on hiking pace.
- Permit / reservation: Online permit required but no hard quota on number available.

## What to pair it with
- Nearby stops: There are some nearby nice waterfalls throughout the area such as Panther Creek Falls. Mt. St. Helens is a bit further away but also very scenic.

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Highly recommended - Ice Axe, Crampons/Shoe Spikes, Waterproof Shoes/Boots. Additionaly Useful - Glacier/Sunglasses, Warm Socks, Winter Coat Layers, Trekking Poles, Transponder
- Water: You can generally melt snow or filter from creeks if needed.
- Weather hazards: The cascades are infamous for forming their own weather systems. Blizzards can and will happen throughout the year even in summer. Be aware of the weather forecast and don't be afraid to turn around if necessary.
