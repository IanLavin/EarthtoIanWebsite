### Getting There
Accessible from Palm Springs or the Mojave Desert via multiple entrances. About 2.5 hours from Los Angeles.

### Time & Season
Fall through spring is ideal. Summers are dangerously hot for hiking.

### Getting Around
Driving between areas is essential. Short walks lead to many highlights; longer hikes explore quieter desert sections.

### What to Pair With
Great alongside Palm Springs, Anza-Borrego, or a Southern California road trip.

### Notes
Temperatures swing dramatically between day and night. Stargazing here is exceptional.
