### Getting There
Crater Lake is located in southern Oregon, roughly 1.5 hours from Medford or Bend. Access is via Rim Drive, though some roads close seasonally due to snow.

### Time & Season
Late July through September is the best window, when most roads and trails are fully open. Winter access is limited but stunning, with deep snow and fewer visitors.

### Getting Around
Rim Drive provides access to major viewpoints, but hiking is required to reach features like Cleetwood Cove. Expect significant elevation changes.

### What to Pair With
Pairs well with Bend, Umpqua Hot Springs, or a broader Oregon road trip including the Cascades or coast.

### Notes
Weather can change quickly even in summer. Check road conditions before arrival, especially outside peak season.
