## Getting there
- Closest airport: You will almost certainly be flying into Cusco.
- Drive time: Shuttles to/from Cusco are highly variable depending on traffic but assume 3-4 hours each way. 
- Trailhead / entry point: Nearly all hikes will likely start in the small village of Pajchanta.

## Time & season
- Best months: Peru experiences two distinct seasons of cold and dry and a warm and wet. You will very likely want to go during the colder and drier season. This generally runs May-August. 
- Typical start time: Most trips are formatted as day excursions from Cusco. Pickup is generally around 4-5AM for a 9AM arrival and breakfast. Return times are generally between 3-5PM.
- Permit / reservation: None required but booking through a reputable tour company vastly simplifies the logistics of arriving.

## What to pair it with
- Good multi-day combo:  Located close by to the far more well known and famous Rainbow mountain. Can be done as a multi day trip combining the two together. 

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Only regular hiking gear required.
- Water: High altitude so dehydration can be quite common. Drink lots of water with electrolytes and force yourself to eat even when your appetite gets inevitably dulled by the altitude.
- Weather hazards: Be prepared for potential cold/windy weather conditions no matter the time of year.
