## Getting there
- Closest airport: Key west has one but unless you are loaded with cash it make more sense to go to Miami and drive
- Drive time: 4 hours from Miami. The island is only accessable via a multi hour boat ride or short plane ride.
- Trailhead / entry point: No matter if you are going via boat or plane, you will be departing from Key West.

## Time & season
- Best months: Winter waters can be choppy and unclear. Summer is hurricane season and prone to cancelations. Aim for the shoulder season either April - June or Oct - Dec
- Typical start time: All boat tours or plane tours depart early moring usually around 7-8 AM and return 3-5 PM.
- Permit / reservation: National park pass required

## What to pair it with
- Nearby stops: Key west has a number of interesting things to do like fishing or snorkeling.
- Good multi-day combo: If you are already passing through Miami you may as well visit Biscayne. Depending on your luck it could have even better snorkeling than Dry Tortugas.

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Swimsuit, Sunscreen, Towel
- Water: Bring your own as the island has none. Boats usually sell water at a cost.
- Weather hazards: Hurricane season is unsuitable for travel and trips are often canceled. Wind can sometimes also be a problem and lead to bumpy sea crossings.
