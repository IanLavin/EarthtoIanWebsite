## Getting there
- Closest airport: While there are small region airports at some of the ski valleys, the closest major airport is probably Denver.
- Drive time: Around 5 hours from Denver.
- Trailhead / entry point: Most hikes/viewpoints are accessable from Rim Drive Rd.

## Time & season
- Best months: Road is closed Nov-April. Outside of that late summer/fall is the most plesant time.
- Typical start time: Most hikes are short so start time isnt critical, if hiking into canyon however the earlier the better.
- Permit / reservation: Standard national park pass.

## What to pair it with
- Nearby stops: Maroon Bells or Telluride are both fantastic mountain towns with stunning vistas.
- Good multi-day combo: Best expereinced as part of a road trip across southwest Colorado. Telluride, Mesa Verde National Park, and Ourays million dollar highway are a nice combo.

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Standard hiking gear.
- Water: Bring your own.
- Weather hazards: Closed due to snowfall in winter.
