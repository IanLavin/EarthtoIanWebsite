### Getting There
Located along Northern California’s coast, primarily accessed via Highway 101. Crescent City and Eureka are common entry points.

### Time & Season
Late spring through early fall offers the best weather, though coastal fog is common year-round.

### Getting Around
Many redwood groves require driving on narrow, unpaved roads. Short hikes lead to the most impressive trees.

### What to Pair With
Combines well with the Northern California coast, Oregon coast, or a Pacific Northwest road trip.

### Notes
Fog and drizzle are normal—embrace it. Early mornings are best for quiet trails and dramatic light.
