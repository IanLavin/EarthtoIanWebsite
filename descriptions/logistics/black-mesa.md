## Getting there
- Closest airport: Amarillo (AMA) or Albuquerque (ABQ) (both still a drive)
- Drive time: Plan for a remote approach; services are limited
- Trailhead / entry point: Black Mesa Nature Preserve trailhead; out-and-back hike to the OK highpoint marker

## Time & season
- Best months: Spring and fall (cooler hiking temps)
- Typical start time: Early morning (avoid heat)
- Permit / reservation: Preserve rules apply; no special permit typically, but confirm hours/closures

## What to pair it with
- Nearby stops: Capulin Volcano (NM), Santa Fe/ABQ (if routing), Amarillo stops
- Good multi-day combo: Pair with Mount Sunflower + Panorama Point as a Plains/Southwest road trip

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Hiking shoes; sun protection; expect a longer hike than most Plains highpoints
- Water: Bring plenty (at least 2L per person in warm weather)
- Weather hazards: Heat, wind, thunderstorms; very exposed terrain
