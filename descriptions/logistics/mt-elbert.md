## Getting there
- Closest airport: You will almost certainly be flying into Denver.
- Drive time: A bit over 2 hours from Denver.
- Trailhead / entry point: There are a few different options for trailheads. The two most common are the north or south trailheads. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks.

## Time & season
- Best months: June-August is peak climbing season. Can be climbed outside this window but snow traversal experience is required.
- Typical start time: Early morning start between 5-7AM.
- Permit / reservation: None

## What to pair it with
- Nearby stops: Leadville, Aspen, or Brekenridge are all alpine ski towns with nice vibes.

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Normal hiking gear required.
- Water: Bring your own as none available above 12,000 feet.
- Weather hazards: Thunderstorms can be a daily occurance during the summer. The top is quite exposed and not somewhere you want to be if lightning is present.
