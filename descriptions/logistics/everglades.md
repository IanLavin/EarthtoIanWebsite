## Getting there
- Closest airport: Miami
- Drive time: 1-2 Hours
- Trailhead / entry point: Most walking/bike tours start in Shark Valley. Otherwise airboat tours are located all along Highway 41.

## Time & season
- Best months: Not hurricane season. Shoulder months are ideal for plesant temps and weather. Think March-June or Oct- Dec.
- Typical start time: Flexible
- Permit / reservation: National park pass required

## What to pair it with
- Nearby stops: Since you are already in Miami you will almost certainly be stopping by Biscayne.
- Good multi-day combo: If you're looking for one of the best beaches in the United States Siesta Key is a few hours drive away.

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Walking gear, sunscreen, hat, sunglasses
- Water: Bring your own
- Weather hazards: Hurricane season brings flooding and unplesant rains. Humidity and heat also make summer trips far more unbearable.
