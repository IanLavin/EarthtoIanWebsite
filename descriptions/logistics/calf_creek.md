## Getting there
- Closest airport: Salt Lake City or Vegas are closest options.
- Drive time: 4 - 5 hours depending on airport chosen.
- Trailhead / entry point: Lower Calf Creek Falls trailhead is your only option.

## Time & season
- Best months: Spring to fall is best for warm temps for waterfall swimming.
- Typical start time: Early starts will provide shade from canyon walls and avoid the worst of the heat.
- Permit / reservation: Parking at trailhead is paid.

## What to pair it with
- Nearby stops: Almost certainly you are going to be stopping by one of the nearby national parks including Capitol Reef or Bryce.
- Good multi-day combo: Ideal as part of a roadtrip connecting Utahs national parks. Bentonite hills is another nearby underrate location to check out as well.

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Standard hiking gear, Swimsuit.
- Water: Bring more than you expect to need.
- Weather hazards: Heat will likely be the biggest factor. Flooding is a concern but the canyon is wide enough to mitigate the worst of flash flooding.
