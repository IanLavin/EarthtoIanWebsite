## Getting there
- Closest airport: El Paso is the only reasonably close one.
- Drive time: 2 hour drive from El Paso.
- Trailhead / entry point: National Park Pass required for entry.

## Time & season
- Best months: October - May. Its the desert so generally the biggest concern will be the heat.
- Typical start time: Whenever you feel like. I would probably advise trying to avoid descending in the dark if possible.
- Permit / reservation: None

## What to pair it with
- Good multi-day combo: Due to its remote location you are almost certainly going to be pairing this with the other nearby national parks including Carlsbad Caverns and/or White Sands.

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Regular hiking gear.
- Water: Plenty of water fill stations in the park.
- Weather hazards: While not extremly prominent, the summit can still be subjected to bad weather. Lightning espcially can be a risk due to the exposed nature of the final few hundered feet.
