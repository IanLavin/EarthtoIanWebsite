## Getting there
- Closest airport: Boise is the most obvious choice for 90% of people. Smaller airports exist at Twin Falls and Idaho Falls. 
- Drive time: 3-4 hours from Boise.
- Trailhead / entry point: Borah peak trailhead has primitive camping available. Almost all climbs will start from this trailhead.

## Time & season
- Best months: July-Sept is peak season. Snow can linger through July depending on the year and August snowstorms are uncommon but not impossible.
- Typical start time: Early morning to beat any potential weather build up later in the day. Typically 5-7AM
- Permit / reservation: None required, it's Idaho they don't believe in such things.

## What to pair it with
- Nearby stops: Craters of the moon is the most obvious nearby attraction and you will likely pass by it on the way to/from Boise. Stanley and the Sawtooth range also provide additonal scenic mountain views.

## Safety & prep
- Gear notes: Normal hiking gear required. If early season or after recent snows shoe spikes and ice axe can be helpful.
- Water: None available on mountain or nearby. Bring all you need you're on your own.
- Weather hazards: Like all mountains in the Rockies can be susceptable to afternoon thunderstorms. Check weather forecasts and be aware of lightning as there is very little shelter near the top.
