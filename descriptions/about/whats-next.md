This website is continously being updated and I will try my best to keep it up to date with everywhere I have been. Outside of that I have some additional things I hope to continue to expand upon going forward. Some things to keep an eye out for in the future include features such as:

- Additional photos per location or more interactive photo gallery
- Timeline of when different locations were visited or are best to visit.
- Interative feature on map showing roadtrips and how locations can be combined together
- And more...
