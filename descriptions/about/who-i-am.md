My name is Ian and there's nothing I love more than getting outside and exploring the world around us! From deserts to mountains, beaches, forests, and more, theres so many amazing landscapes waiting to be discovered. During this process, I began documenting my travels and posting videos about them on my social media. However, I wanted somewhere I could collect all of those travels together into one easily accessible location to display and share. Thats how this website was born. Here you'll be able to see all of the many differnt places I've explored as well as their associated video posts, additional photos, and notes and logistics from my experiences traveling there! There's a ton of content explore and this website is continuing to be updated as I travel more so stick around and see what new places get added next!
