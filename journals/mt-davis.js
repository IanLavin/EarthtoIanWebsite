      For the final part of the day we cut up through the corner of Maryland headed to the highpoint of Pennsylvania. The drive continued to be uneventful, with only the forested green hills of before now replaced by gentle rolling farmland as far as the eye could see.
      The only entertainment were small mailbox signs petitioning passers by to repent their sins of adultery and lust and turn towards Jesus. Only a short time of an hour of this persisted before we reached our final destination.
      We crossed into Pennsylvania and followed a small gravel road up a hillside towards Mt Davis park. We stopped briefly at a lookout clearing over a small lake which provided some perfectly adequate views.
      We continued on and eventually reached the summit parking lot, surrounded only by five or six other people milling about. We headed down a brief trail towards the lookout tower, a metal firewatch structure around forty feet tall with a narrow switchback staircase leading to the top.
      The views from the top were alright, mostly rolling hills with little to almost no prominence to speak of.
      The wind continued to blow a bit less strongly than before and it added a bit of chill to the air. We performed our picture video routine for a final time before climbing down and walking around some rocks with information about the area.
      They included a sign stating that the signs were old from the 70s and going to be replaced soon and after one glance it was quickly apparent why. The original name of the mountain contained a quite offensive term and another unpleasant term was used to describe the original native inhabitants.
      Taking a few moments to process this info we then decided to return to the car and continue on. Our final destination lay in Philadelphia and we began a bit less than a four hour drive.
      I fell asleep for a portion of the drive so it passed rather quickly, but we soon arrived at my aunt and uncle's house and Har dropped me off with my things, thus concluding our east coast Appalachian journey. However one final small highpoint still remained uncompleted hidden in the suburbs of Delaware.
