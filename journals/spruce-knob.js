      We woke up today prepared to hit three more of the highpoints back to back. Our intention for the day was to hit West Virginia, followed by Maryland and finally Pennsylvania.
      After stopping by Walmart for some supplies to fix my shoes, we went back to Har’s relatives for a morning breakfast. We eventually headed out around 9:30 am for the 3 and a half hour drive to Spruce Knob.
      It was a mostly cloudy day with scattered lines of grey clouds passing quickly above. We drove down small narrow roads through the hills and by tiny mountainous towns in states of various repair.
      Eventually we reached the base of Spruce Knob and began up a steep narrow road towards the top of the mountain. As we approached the peak the scenery surprisingly began to change, shifting from the deciduous forest to which we were so accustomed into a more familiar rocky and pine tree forest.
      Eventually we reached the top and parked the car in a small lot. We followed a mild trail through the woods as the strong winds of around 30 mph whipped around us.
      We passed by a few signs and rock piles, and at one point reached a 30 foot or so watchtower. Despite its height however the trees around it proved too tall and it provided little if any views of the surrounding landscape.
      Continuing down the trail however led us to a slightly better flat overlook on a few rocks, enough to see a number of rolling green hills in the distance.
      We took in the views for a few minutes and made sure to get the obligatory photos before traversing back along the remainder of the loop trail and back to the car to continue on for the day.
