      Waking up in New Haven, I knew I had a long day ahead of me. We got an early start at 6:30AM, both because of my upcoming flight, as well as the heavy nor'easter rain predicted for the day. 
      We arrived at the airport around nine without too much difficulty however and Har wished me off while I headed to my flight. This is where my fun for the day would officially begin. 
      My flight was delayed for an hour due to mechanical issues. Then, even once we boarded the plane we were stuck in a queue of 30 planes on the runway waiting to take off. 
      In total, it ended up taking three hours longer to reach Cleveland than I anticipated. Needless to say, this threw off my plans a bit. Once I arrived I quickly rushed to grab my rental car and hit the road. My first stop was Cuyahoga Valley National Park. 
      It was nothing special, with the main attraction Brandywine falls feeling more like a city park waterfall than one deserving of national park status. Its central location within the city of Cleveland certainly didn't help either. 
      The one thing I will give it props for is the fact that even with the government shutdown, they still made sure to have a backup visitor center open with stamps and stickers. That alone probably gave it a point boost in my rankings. 
      After taking in what few sights there were, I quickly set off for the highpoint, chasing the setting sun. The drive from there was uneventful, passing endless farms and fields. With the sun now hanging low, I finally pulled up to the destined highpoint. 
      There was a small back road you followed up a tiny hill located on the side of a technical college. After parking you walked only up a few steps and were greeted by a large flagpole and plaque. 
      I took the requisite pictures, which were greatly enhanced by the sunset backdrop and the faint fall colors. In the future, I hope to one day have a brick commemorating Har and my highpointing career here. 
      But for now, I hopped back in the car and darted off to the final highpoint of the trip, Indiana.
