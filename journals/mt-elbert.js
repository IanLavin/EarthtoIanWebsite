      We started at Elbert Portal at 2:30am under a sky full of stars.
      The air was thin but calm, and morale was high.

    <p>
      Sunrise hit just below Trail Crest and lit up the entire Sierra
      Nevada range. Easily one of the most memorable moments of the climb.
    </p>

    <h4>Key Notes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Permits checked at Trail Camp</li>
      <li>Snow patches above 13,500 ft</li>
      <li>Summit wind was brutal</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Reaching the summit sign felt surreal after months of planning.
