      Mount Elbert was a peak I wanted to do long before I began my journey of highpointing. It was on my bucket list for at least four years if not longer. After so much anticipation I finally planned a trip for it.
      The first two days involved the Kansas and Nebraska highpoints as well as a day at Rocky Mountain National Park. Because of a long day there we arrived late at the campsite Sunday night at 10 PM. We set up tents, ate a quick dinner, and were in bed by 11.
      We woke up at 5 AM the next morning and began the 45 min drive to the south trailhead. We chose this path as it was more gradual and more scenic.
      We arrived at the trailhead around 6:30 AM as the sun was about to rise, lighting the partly cloudy sky a fiery orange and giving the top of the mountain a pleasant golden glow. We began our trek by traveling up an old forest service road for two miles.
      It was moderately steep but since we started at 9,600 ft Har and Abhishek were feeling the altitude already. After a brief water crossing we arrived at the upper trailhead. We met a couple with a very energetic dog who would pass us back and forth for the next bit.
      The trail at this point was very pleasant with slight elevation gain winding through fields of aspens. As we continued to climb, these gradually gave way to more pine forests and the trail grew steeper and we switched back up the mountain.
      We were making good progress so far and we reached the timeline a bit below 12,000 feet in around two and a half hours. As we stopped for a snack we were joined by a very friendly bird. We continued our push after this as we entered the alpine tundra.
      The peak appeared to lie dead ahead but we would later learn this was only a false summit. Nevertheless, we pushed on as the altitude started really hitting Har and Abhishek above 12,000 feet.
      We started to get a little worried at this point as we had a schedule to keep if I was going to make it back for my flight that evening. After some slow going, we eventually crossed 13,00 feet .
      At this point we only had an hour left before turnaround was required. They told me to go ahead, so I started to push so I could at least make the top. It was hard going as I was pushing myself beyond my usual limit to reach the peak in time.
      Eventually the summit was finally in sight and I dragged myself up at exactly 5 hours 15 mins. The view from the top was gorgeous, and only slightly dampened by the 30 mph winds ripping by.
      There was also no summit log which was sad. I took some quick videos to commemorate the moment and began back down. I encountered Abhishek about 80 feet below the summit. He was very disappointed to not be able to reach the peak so I told him to just go for it if he ran.
      I continued on and eventually reached Har about 200 feet below the summit. He was also very disappointed at not being able to summit and I felt bad. I knew how much effort he had put in so I decided to try and make it work. I called my mom and asked if she could reschedule my flight.
      I told him to go to the peak and I sat on some rocks while he did. I probably could have re-summited, but my legs were worked from overpacing myself and I was cold from the wind so I just hung out. As long as they got to feel accomplished I was satisfied.
      After getting their own fill they returned back to me in very high spirits and very grateful I allowed them to summit. I told them no big deal but we should head down as the wind on the ridge was ripping at 40mph. 
      It was a slightly chaotic descent, but Abhishek and I made good time down the ridge. We had to wait for Har for a bit but eventually we all made it down to the timberline where the wind became much more benign.
      We enjoyed another snack break and were even rejoined but our original bird friend. After this we continued our speedy descent. The well maintained trail assisted this greatly, and was a joy to descend compared to some other trails I've done.
      We took one last break at the aspen line and we started casually strolling the last few miles. We took a slight detour descending and got to pass a few lakes we had missed on the way up.
      Finally we reached the forest service road and strolled down it to return back to the car almost exactly 9 hours later. It was a hard fought and somewhat stressful day but it all worked out in the end.
