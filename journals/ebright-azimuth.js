      After two days' rest in Philadelphia, I was now ready to undertake the vast challenge of Ebright Azimuth. I completed a day's work and Har grabbed me from my aunts house to undertake our long journey. 
      The car ride there was perilous, navigating the crowded streets of Philadelphia during rush hour. We soon turned off the main road and onto a small quiet street in the suburbs. 
      The houses around looked upon us forebodingly, yet undeterred we pressed ahead. Soon our destination came into view and we located a dirt pulloff where we could stash our car for the time. 
      The area was large and flat with a cell tower in the distance looming menacingly above. Off in the distance a flock of geese stood watching as witnesses to our ascent. 
      We traversed the sidewalk for a good minute or two before finally arriving at the site, a small sign and a broken park bench. The sign had some nice words on it, yet the bench proved much more perilous, rocking uncontrollably when sat upon. 
      Undeterred, we still managed to get what pictures we could to commemorate the occasion. At this point the geese continued to give us intimidating looks, and not wanting a confrontation we set out for the car. 
      Through a harsh gentle breeze, we forged ahead a whole 60 seconds until we reached the sanctuary of the vehicle. Starting it up, we received one final surprise as the site conspired with our GPS to get us turned around driving down the wrong street. 
      Yet despite this, we still managed to get our bearings and head back for our next destination of pizza with one of Har's friends. It was nice to eat a hearty meal after such a voyage and we ate it up before saying our goodbyes and returning back to the house. 
      We had finished all six highpoints and now could catch our breath before the real adventure ahead in Peru.
