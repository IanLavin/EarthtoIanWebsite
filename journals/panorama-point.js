      After our first stop of the Kansas highpoint, we began the four hour drive north to Nebraska. I was the one driving for this section and it was mostly just long stretches of country roads. 
      We had a good time as we did some carpool karaoke for a while and I threw out my voice. We got closer and started driving along another gravel road through a bunch of wind turbines. 
      It was a surprisingly scenic area and it was partly cloudy with rain in the distance which was nice. Eventually after one missed turn, we arrived at the actual gate. We followed a narrow dirt road and soon reached the point. 
      It was extremely modest, with only a small stone marker commemorating the  spot. We also encountered another two people there which was a surprise. They weren't actually highpointers however, but rather were tri-pointers searching for the nearby tripoint of states. 
      We talked with them for a while before taking some pictures and making sure to sign the logbook. After some final appreciation of the scenery we headed to Cheyenne. 
      It was a boring drive there, however once arriving we walked around the city a bit. It was then we went into a random arcade so Har could play the lottery. After that, we headed out on the way to Fort Collins. 
      We got dinner at a nice restaurant and we got to walk around the downtown of Fort Collins a bit. It was the first football game of the year so there were CSU students everywhere out and about. 
      We eventually made our way back and got to the hotel which was a bit wack. The first room we were supposed to get didn't have AC, then the second one had no water. 
      Finally after getting a second key for the third room, we were able to bed down for the night and get to sleep before the next section of the journey.
