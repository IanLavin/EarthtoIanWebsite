      Mt Borah was my first ever state highpoint and I did it back when I was 9 years old. As such I don't fully remember all of it but this is a reconstruction based on what I do and pictures. 
      When I was in the 4th grade we had done a module on Idaho where I had learned interesting state facts. One of these facts was that the state highpoint was called Mount Borah. 
      I had told my parents about this and also said that I wanted to climb Borah. My dad agreed and after waiting until summer we finally went at the beginning of August. 
      The drive was only 3-4 hours but we arrived at the base and set up a tent for the night. It was very rainy throughout the night and up higher on the mountain there was a blizzard happening. We woke up very early around 5:00am or so to begin our hike up. 
      It was forested and pitch black down there and I apparently almost got lost at one point. We continued on however and made it above the tree line to an angled talus field around 6:30 as the sun was beginning to rise. 
      At this point there was only sparse vegetation and a faint windy trail up the slope. We walked along the edge of the cliffs which looked like upturned rock with striped patterns running along their sides. 
      The trail soon became steeper and we approached a narrow ridge known as chicken out ridge. This section was about 50 feet or so long and was a class 3 - 3.5 scrabble that required you to crawl along the ridge which was 5-6 feet wide. 
      On the right side there was a steep exposure of a few hundred feet while the left was a more modest 20-30. I remember being very scared but I managed to crawl across it and reach the end by 8:00 AM. 
      At this point my dad and I had met fellow climbers who took our picture and joined us heading up. We then had to cross a snow bridge which was a knife edge ridge covered in a thin layer of snow. 
      After this we reached the other side and began the final ascent to the top. It was a very steep large talus field covered in snow with no real defined path. While it was slow going we pushed on and finally reached the peak of Borah at 10:13AM. 
      It was very snowy at the top with a few small other groups of hikers. There was an official flag with the mountain name and year on it rolled in a canister to protect it. My dad and I took a picture with it to mark the occasion. 
      By this point it was partly cloudy and as the clouds rolled past they would cover the peak and blanket us in fog. We remained up there for 20 more mins or so before heading back down at 10:33, where I took an interesting photo. 
      On the way back down we had wanted to avoid crossing the snow bridge again so we went a bit off trail and cut down the side below it. We learned this trick from a fellow hiker who had hiked all 50 highpoints and this was his final one. 
      I think this random man was the first to ever describe this accomplishment and it set me down the path that led me to where I am today. Continuing on through we cut along the side of chicken out ridge, where once I reached the bottom I took another iconic photo. 
      We continued on and the trail became much easier as it was back to the switchbacks. We reached the end of the talus slopes by 12:41 and headed back into the trees. Finally the campsite came into view at 2:11 PM and we made the final push back, completing the hike at 2:17 PM. 
      My dad and I packed up our tents and got in the car to drive home. On the way we stopped at craters of the moon at 4:03 PM, explored a bit, then returned to Eagle. Overall, while I didn't think much of it at the time, this trip helped inspire my love of hiking, climbing mountains. 
      I would use chicken out ridge as an example of what I could overcome and it made me a stronger person. I'm glad I did this when I was so young and one day maybe I'll even return to the mountain that started it all.
