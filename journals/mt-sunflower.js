      This highpoint was part of a trip hitting three different highpoints over a Labor day weekend. The trip started off with leaving Phoenix late Friday night. 
      My flight was a bit earlier than Har’s and Abhishek’s, so when I arrived first, I grabbed all the bags and quickly boarded the shuttle since we were worried the rental car place would close by the time we arrived. 
      Thankfully, everyone arrived on time and we even got an upgrade to a larger SUV. After a late night run to Taco Bell, we arrived at the hotel and crashed by 2:00 AM. Next working was an early one, with a wake up at 8:00 AM to be on the road by 9:15. 
      We stopped by a Walmart to get supplies needed for the upcoming days, and were on the road by 10:15. The drive was uneventful as we mostly were traveling through farm fields. 
      We drove for about three hours before arriving at the edge of Mount Sunflower down a long gravel road. It was a very unassuming spot with no real prominence above the surrounding area. 
      What it did have instead, was a large herd of cows. They stood blocking the road, and we had to wait and try to shoo them out of the way. Eventually the bovines relented and allowed us to proceed to the summit. 
      There was a nice little iron monument commemorating the spot, which had its name as well as the height and a log book. Fields stretched out as far as the eye could see, and half a mile away the invisible border of Colorado traversed along the ground. 
      We took our pictures and looked at the little book exchange they had there, before preparing to hop back in the car and proceed to the next highpoint of the day.
