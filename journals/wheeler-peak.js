      This highpoint was the second part of a two part trip over Memorial day weekend 2024. The climb started when I woke up at 4:30 AM. We were camped by a creek and the roaring of the water woke me up abruptly.
      After laying in my sleeping bag for another 20 mins, I quickly got up and began to pack my supplies. We were up at the ski valley by 6:00 AM and made our way to the Williams lake trailhead. 
      It was a quiet morning, with only a few other cars around.The moon hung low above the peaks surrounding us, illuminating the bright white snow we would soon encounter. We set off just before 6:30, walking through the chairlift area. 
      Immediately Har started saying that the Subway we had the previous night was not sitting well and his stomach was hurting. While mine didn't feel great either, we pushed ahead. The trail was quiet for the first mile with a few small stream crossings but nothing out of the ordinary. 
      Soon however patches of snow began to appear around the trees and the trail gradually gave way to a firm boot pack across the snow. We continued along slowly, with the altitude and lack of prior training starting to take its toll on Har. 
      After another mile or so of snow walking, we arrived at the turnoff before Williams lake. This was where the true climb would begin, and we stopped for a brief snack break to prepare. 
      My GoPro was acting up a bit at this point, due to the batteries being cold and frozen. Soon however we were off climbing through snowy switchbacks up the side. At this point we reached our first real challenge, a snow climb of about 600 feet at 20-30 degrees. 
      Despite the novelty, Har took this part slow and steady and we climbed to the top in decent time. This however is where some problems began. We arrived in a large snow basin, and I climbed a nearby ridge to scout ahead. 
      Har however tried to traverse through the center and started postholing for about 100 feet. This in turn started to break his confidence and he doubted he would make it to the top. I kept encouraging him however and we continued making extremely slow progress up. 
      It was a grinding process with multiple stops and moments of encouragement to keep him moving up the mountainside. After the long slog however, we were finally able to exit the snowfield and enter back onto dry land. 
      There were only a few switchbacks remaining to the summit, and bit by bit we worked our way to the peak nearly five hours after we had started. Despite it all, it was a gorgeous peak with all the surrounding snow speckled summits lighting up the slopes of the mountains. 
      We enjoyed the views for about 25 minutes with surprisingly light winds and partial clouds passing by. We had a schedule to try and keep however, so we set back off down the mountain. All was going well until we reencountered the snow. 
      It was a slope about 30 degrees with a bad runout near the bottom, and Har was uncomfortable with it being his first time, so I lent him my ice axe. It was a rough start, at one point nearly losing control and needing to perform a basic self arrest to stop, 
      but things slowly started to improve. The second slope was much more forgiving and slowly Har was beginning to learn proper glissading form and control. 
      By the time we returned back to that first snow climb things were much better and we were able to have a fun time sliding down the snowy slopes. We reached the bottom and began the long snow walk back to the car. 
      Thankfully, the snow was still firm, despite it being near midday, due to the shade from the thicket of trees. We got a bit off route headed back and ended up on a dirt road leading right back to the car. We finally arrived nearly nine hours after starting and changed out of our wet clothes. 
      We also met a man who was there training for a Rainier climb and chatted with him for a bit. Soon it was time to hit the road though to try and floor it on the way to Great Sand Dunes. 
      It was a fun, decently challenging mountain overall that could be a bit rough at times, yet still all managed to work out in the end, making for another successful highpoint trip.
