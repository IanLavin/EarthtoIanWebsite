      Climbing this peak was part of a larger Memorial day camping trip in 2023. It started with a drive to Texas and a stop at Chirachaua national monument. I slept at the campsite, but probably only got five hours or so of sleep.
      Despite being tired, we set off for Carlsbad early Sunday morning. We arrived at 10:30AM and were headed out to Guadalupe by 12:45. We pulled up to the park around 1:30PM and the first thing I did was get my brand new passport book stamped.
      I quickly got everyone to head for the trail as I was worried about being on the mountain too late. The trail started with a decently steep section of incline mixed with wooden stairs. The sun was out at this point and it was hot and sweaty climbing.
      The temperature was probably in the high 70s or low 80s. Har was struggling at this first section and I would often go ahead and wait at various points letting him catch up to me.
      We made slow and steady progress up a series of switchbacks until we crossed along a rocky ridge with some drop offs on the side. We crested over the ridge and found ourselves facing a large ponderosa forest.
      It was a nice change of pace from the desert below and I really enjoyed the gradual incline through the trees. By now it was about 90 mins in or so. We saw some concerning clouds starting to build up in the distance but we pressed on.
      We continued up further, passing a few groups while constantly checking the weather app. By now we had about a mile and a half left to the top. Har told me he was worried about slowing us down and getting caught in a storm but I told him it would be alright.
      We pressed forward past a high campsite and finally broke the treeline. By now we had about a mile left and a few hundred feet to climb. We also started hearing the crack of thunder and saw lightning on the plains below.
      I started trying to push us faster to outrun the storm. We approached the final half mile where the trail got steeper and rockier. Har's leg began to cramp and he would have to stop every 50 yards or so.
      I kept encouraging him to finish however and we slowly pushed to the top. We reached the summit at 4:45 PM, taking about 2:45 mins to climb up. There was an odd monument built by American Airlines up there which I took some pictures with.
      We had the summit mostly to ourselves with only one fellow hiker joining a few minutes after us. We had still been lucky with the storm avoiding us but the continued thunder and lightning weren't exactly comforting to see from the mountaintop.
      We had some quick snacks and took a few more videos before agreeing we should probably head down. As we started down the first section however Har’s leg cramped up and he called for my help.
      He was starting to get a bit freaked out, being unable to move his leg while we were stuck at the peak with an incoming storm. But we were thankfully able to stretch it out and able to get back moving again.
      We made a quick beeline for below the treeline where some of my worries dissipated as we arrived. We continued at a fast pace hoping our luck would hold and the storm would avoid us.
      Thankfully it did, and we reached the ridge crest with the car now in sight again. Using this as motivation we continued to head down the mountain and began to pass some groups ahead of us which helped to lift Har’s spirit.
      We also got hit with a few minutes of misting rain but not much more than that. Finally, we soon approached the car and Har was excited that we could be finished in under five hours.
      Using this excitement, we jogged the final stretch and arrived back at the car at about 6:54 PM for a round tip of 4:54 hours. We got to see the sun set behind the mountain a little bit after jumping in the car and beginning the next long stretch of driving to our final campsite.
