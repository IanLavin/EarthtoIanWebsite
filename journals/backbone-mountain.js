      We continued the drive along through similar scenery until after around an hour and a half we reached our next destination of Backbone Mountain.
      There was no official lot, just a small roadside pulloff with a sign as the only indication. We parked alongside the winding road and quickly began our ascent up the nearby trail.
      It was a fairly uneventful hike, only around a mile each way with around 700 feet of elevation gain total. The ground was covered in leaves and puddles of mud from recent rains, making for a somewhat squishy and hazardous stepping at times.
      The trail inclines were quite modest until around the final quarter mile where all of the elevation seemed to be located. We soon reached the top though and followed along a short rolling path until we reached a small clearing with a sign and a mailbox indicating we had reached our destination.
      The top was mostly surrounded by trees save for a cutout around twenty feet wide creating a window to look out upon the rolling green hillsides below. We signed our names into a larger register within the mailbox and took all of the requisite photos.
      After a bit, a man reached our location at the top of the trail and chatted with us momentarily about the hike and similar hikes done in the past. He also mentioned flying a kite on the different hikes he had done which seemed like a good idea.
      After a bit more chatting we began our descent down the hill which passed by relatively quickly and uneventfully. We reached the car and quickly packed our things and began the next hike before realizing one final surprise from the hike.
      Hanging from the trees were a number of small caterpillars on silk and we were now covered in them. We pulled over and quickly brushed off any that remained upon us, before now having been adequately cleaned off, continuing the journey onwards.
