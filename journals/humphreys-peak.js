      I had been wanting to hike this trail ever since I moved to Arizona.
      After delaying for 2 weeks due to rainy weather the opportunity finally arose on a Friday, the last day of the year before there would be snow on the peak.
      I tried to convince some of my other coworkers to go but they were unable to do so due to work. I was able to move around my training so that I could get Har to join me.
      We left from Tempe at around 8AM after I picked up Har. The weather was perfect and clear without a cloud in the sky. We drove a little over two hours, stopping for gas once.
      When we arrived at the trailhead it was a pleasant 70 degrees with large groves of aspen trees giving the area a nice yellow color. We set off at 10:40 AM, with there being tons of other hikers on the trail near the base.
      Har’s shins started acting up a bit but thankfully the two Advil we had both taken seemed to help. The first mile was quick going with us averaging a sub 20 min pace. After completing the first of four switchbacks we stopped for a brief snack.
      The altitude was about 10,000 feet but we didn't really feel the effects too much yet. The next few switchbacks passed by relatively smoothly with us meeting a pair of dudes hiking up on a nearby talus field.
      With each subsequent mile, Har was starting to feel the altitude more and more and our pace began to slow significantly. By the time we reached the end of the four switchbacks Har was questioning if he would go to the top.
      Now above 11,000 feet, we had a short steep section to go before reaching the saddle a few hundred more feet up. We arrived at the saddle a bit after 1:30 and stopped for a late lunch. Har was really feeling the altitude now as he was struggling to catch his breath.
      A little after 2 PM, I convinced Har to at least try the first of the four false summits. It was slow going with the trail becoming a steeper alpine scramble as the trees began to disappear. Very slow work but we made it to the first summit.
      Har wanted to stop and maybe turn around but I kept pushing him. The second false summit was the worst, with frequent breaks required. But we made it and soon the third and final false summit was in view.
      After this there was just a short ridge walk and a final 30 feet or so to the top. With quite a bit of convincing Har made it to the third false summit with the true peak just 100 feet away.
      I convinced him of one final push and we reached the peak at 3:23 PM. The view from the top was stunning with full 360 degree views of the surrounding landscape. Yellow aspen groves dotted the landscape forming a patchwork quilt of trees.
      To the north, the narrow white band of the grand canyon's north rim could be spotted. Nearby Aggasiz peak provided an imposing companion and a glance to the side showed a steep slope running 6000 feet to the base.
      We celebrated our accomplishment with snacks and photos while also signing the logbook. Har was even able to receive a phone call from his mom with surprisingly good reception.
      We enjoyed about half an hour on the peak before the numerous flies and increasing wind caused us to begin our descent. I switched out of my tennis shoes and into sturdier hiking boots with better grip.
      We made good time heading down towards the saddle, arriving in about an hour at 4:50PM. The sun was starting to sit very low so we knew we had to pick up the pace. Having arrived now back at the switchbacks we picked up the pace to a light jog.
      We were able to make it about halfway through the switchbacks by the time the sun set. We stopped at the same talus field as before to sit and watch as the sun set above a golden field of trees. With about 2.5 miles left to go we continued our quick pace.
      The trail got so dark we were forced to use our phone flashlights to illuminate the path. By this point we were the only ones left on the mountain and it was somewhat unnerving running through the dark woods alone.
      However we managed to finally reach the car at 6:39 PM as the last rays of light disappeared from the horizon. We finished our journey by changing to comfortable shoes, stopping for Canes chicken, and beginning the drive back home.
