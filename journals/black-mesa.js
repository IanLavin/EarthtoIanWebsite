      This highpoint was the first of two over the long memorial day weekend of 2024. We started by flying into Denver early on Saturday morning. After grabbing a rental car we set off down to Colorado Springs to meet Aiden. 
      We visited his house and decided to go to brunch in town. When we arrived, we encountered an outdoor festival. We stopped and got some quick waffles, before walking around the festival a bit. 
      After this, we decided to drive up Pikes peak. It was a beautiful drive passing by alpine lakes, streams, and through snow near the top. Once we arrived, we parked and walked around a bit. 
      It was moderately cold, but with wind bursts up to 40mph it could get freezing fast. There was a fun little visitor center at the top selling food and souvenirs, and we browsed for a bit before getting back in the car and heading down the mountain. 
      After a quick stop for some supplies and food, we arrived back at Aidens place for the night. We hung out for a bit before turning in early after a long day. We woke up around 6:30 AM the following day, and after a quick shower we hopped on the road for our four hour drive to Oklahoma. 
      The drive was mostly uneventful, with a mix of eastern Colorado farmlands and bushy mesas. At one point, we were on a narrow two track road and passed by a scary looking house before then having to ford a shallow river. 
      Finally however, we arrived at the black mesa trailhead. The site itself wasn't terribly impressive, being on the side of a few hundred foot tall mesa not any more noticeably taller than the surrounding ones. 
      However we laced up and began the long walk to the top. We traveled along a wide flat old jeep road. For the first two miles there was very little elevation gain, with only the beating sun up above. 
      Finally after a while we reached the only real incline. Thankfully, there was stocked bottled water, so we downed that before starting up. 
      The climb was brief and easy, and the only exciting part was the sight of the crumbling black sides of the mesa giving the area its distinct name. Soon we reached the top to reveal a large flat plateau. 
      From this point, it was hard to determine if you were elevated at all. We wandered across this vast flat expanse for about a mile until finally coming upon a lonely granite pillar marking the true highest point. 
      Without the pillar, it likely would have been impossible to determine the true highest point. There was a small bench for sitting on and the pillar had engravings listing the distances to a few other highpoints which was a nice touch. 
      After sitting for a bit and taking some pictures, we started the long walk to the car. The way back was uneventful, with the only real nuisance being the unrelenting sun shining without a cloud in the sky. 
      This was definitely not a highpoint to do in the heat of summer. At last we arrived back at the car a bit over three hours later. We quickly packed up and hit the road for our next four hour section to Taos. 
      It was an alright drive until we passed through a state park in New Mexico called Cimarron Canyon. It actually had some pretty nice views. Eventually we arrived in Taos, grabbed some food from a Subway, filled up gas, and traveled up the canyon towards the ski valley. 
      After a bit of searching, we found a nice secluded campsite by a stream to set up and crash for the night before our big day tomorrow climbing Wheeler peak.
