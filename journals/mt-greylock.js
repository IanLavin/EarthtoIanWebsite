      After wrapping up at the Connecticut highpoint we headed off on our way to the next stop, Mt Greylock. The drive there was uneventful, however things got a bit more interesting as we got closer. 
      Unlike all the other highpoints this trip, this one actually had some prominence of over 2500 ft. In fact, due to the overcast day we had chosen, this resulted in the summit of the mountain being totally obscured in the clouds. 
      As we drove the winding road up we found ourselves inside the thick cloud layer and in a seemingly endless void. The wind had also started picking up and whipped around us at 30mph. 
      We finally made it to the parking lot and stumbled out into the grey abyss searching for the top. Similar to the New Jersey point, this also contained a monument at the peak which you could climb up. 
      We went inside and climbed to the top up a long spiral staircase. The room at the top however was less exciting, as the views out all sides were nothing but grey abyss. We quickly descended down and stepped back outside to a cloudy hillside. 
      While on a better day I would imagine beyond it might lay nice views of the surrounding countryside, for us it only served as a wind funnel, channeling the clouds into a potent spray of mist. 
      We allowed ourselves a few moments to get drenched and take it in before moving on. Stumbling around in the clouds we continued our way over to the official sign. A couple of photos and videos later and we were ready to get back into the car. 
      We hurried our way back to its warm refuge and took off on the final leg of the journey to the highpoint of Rhode Island.
