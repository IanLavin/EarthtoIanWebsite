      This was the first of six highpoints on this trip to the east coast. It started out with me flying to Philadelphia. My flight had a layover in Los Angeles, but due to mechanical issues it was delayed and I missed my connection which was quite annoying. 
      I eventually made it to the city where I met my family and attended my great uncle's funeral. After doing that on Friday and Saturday it was finally on Sunday when the highpointing would begin. 
      The weather forecast looked quite bad with a nor'easter forecasted to dump loads of rain on the area. Undeterred however we set out, with Har picking me up that morning around 7:45 AM. 
      The first stretch to New Jersey was fairly uneventful as we passed through seemingly endless small farms and neighborhoods. But soon we arrived at High Point state park. 
      Normally you would have to pay to enter, but perhaps due to the current government shutdown we were able to get in for free. There were some nice fall colors on the trees we passed by on the way to the main attraction, a massive monument on the point. 
      It was over 280 feet tall and actually fairly impressive. We pulled into a small parking lot at its base and walked up towards it. Thankfully it seemed we had outrun the rain so far, as it was only windy and overcast but dry. 
      Once we got closer we realized it was actually possible to enter the monument and climb to its top for 1$. Not wanting to pass up this opportunity we paid and were immediately greeted by a massive spiral staircase. 
      There were so many stairs it was comical and we laughed through the giant echoey structure until we reached the top. The views from the top were alright, probably impressive on a fair weather day but the stairs were honestly the most entertaining part of it all. 
      We briefly took it all in before quickly descending back to the bottom and outside again. We then took in a few more views and tried to find the USGS marker, which we eventually were able to locate with the help of nearby staff. 
      Snapping some final pictures we began to feel the faint trickle of rain starting and knew it was time to move on. We hopped back into the car and started off on to the next leg of our trip to the highpoint of Connecticut.
