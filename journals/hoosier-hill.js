      The final highpoint of my trip of six and this one passed by in a blur. I was running late due to a delay flying from the east coast and thus already knew I would likely be arriving to the point in the dark. 
      The sun was close to setting when I left Ohio, and despite speeding along the roads, I couldn't seem to catch it in time. I passed by countless small houses and towns as a creeping darkness grew behind me. 
      The drive was not too long to reach it, but the ticking clock of light made every lost minute feel impactful. The Indiana highpoint was just across the border, and located down a small quiet dirt road I unceremoniously raced my rented corolla down. 
      I nearly overshot it, as it was located in a thicket of trees off the side of the road. There was only a sliver of glow left of the horizon by this point so I was only able to take a photo of the stone proudly proclaiming this as Indiana’s highest point. 
      There was a faint trail leading back into the woods, but not wanting to unintentionally trespass on the property located next to the highpoint, I decided this would have to suffice. A few moments of appreciating this point later, I decided to hop back in the car before I could be asked to leave. 
      I set off for my destination of Columbus Ohio. By pure coincidence it also happened to be Columbus day which was a fun detail. The first part of the drive was actually enjoyable with a really hilly country road that gave you a moment of weightlessness as your car flew down it. 
      The rest of the drive was far less eventful. I reached the outskirts of the city where I got some Wendy's to go for some undiscernable reason and checked into the hotel I’d booked. It was a short sleep that night before waking up at 5:30 for my morning flight back to Phoenix.
      Despite all the delays and complications, I was able to successfully achieve what I set out to do and hit all six highpoints and a national park in two days.
