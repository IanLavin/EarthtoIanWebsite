      Leaving behind the windy fog of Massachusetts, we descended our way down the mountain and onwards to the final destination of the day. It was starting to get later in the day and it had become fairly clear at this point we wouldn't reach the point before sunset. 
      We made a quick stop for some gas and Taco Bell, and as the sun was setting behind us we journeyed on. The rain started to finally pick up at this point into a steady downpour. Darkness had fully fallen across the sky as we eventually pulled up to the highpoint. 
      It was located just off the side of the road and quite easy to miss even without darkness and rain clouding our view. A bit unsure if we were at the right place or merely about to trespass, we walked down a flooded dirt road into the woods. 
      Thankfully, our intuition paid off and we were at the correct place. The walk back to the point was quite short, yet in the dark and rainy woods illuminated only by the flashlights of our phones it felt much longer than it was. 
      We soon reached the main event, a small clearing with a boulder, a park bench, and a summit log. We signed our names into the log and futilely tried to get any photos or videos we could in the dark. 
      The best we could manage were a series of blurry videos and overexposed selfies with flash. Trying to be satisfied with this paltry showing, we set back off towards the car. 
      Once again walking through the dark woods was an experience on its own, but we were soon back at the car in no time. We left as quickly as we had arrived, and stopped for pizza on our way back at this restaurant in New Haven that was supposedly quite good. 
      It was indeed some pretty tasty pizza and we ate it up quickly before retreating back to our hotel for the night. There we got some sleep as I prepared for my journey to continue on with another long day ahead.
