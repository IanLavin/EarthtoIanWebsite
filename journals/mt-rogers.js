      The drive down from Black Mountain was mostly uneventful, Har took a nap while I tried to keep myself awake as best I could along the monotonous winding roads. It was only around 2 and a half hours but that time drug on quite a bit initially.
      We were headed for Greyson Highlands State Park. Once we finally arrived, we prepared for the hike and set off around 3PM. High winds of around 40 mph were predicted for the summit so we were prepared for that as well as large amounts of mud from the day's rain.
      The initial first mile or so was quite easy, a series of very gradual inclines up moderate well graded slopes. The trail was quite popular with numerous people around, but finally we reached the first significant section of the trail, the highland ridges.
      These consisted of 2-3 ridges with little vegetation save for short brushy bushes and green grassland. Numerous boulders were scattered across the landscape and we continued to navigate amongst them as well as the mud and runoff around.
      At this point as well, the wind started to come out in full force, whipping past us and making it difficult to talk and occasionally even balance. One highlight however was we encountered our first herd of longhorns, casually grazing amongst the grass.
      They were hard to spot initially but once we did there must have been at least 20 among them. We continued on from there, traversing up rocky improved steps and passing a few interesting landmarks such as a tunnel through the rocks.
      We finally reached the next section of trail which consisted of a flatter pinecone forest with numerous locations for camping. There were quite a number of tents set up there, the trees doing wonders for breaking up the harsh winds around, and we continued on.
      We soon stumbled upon our next sight of the day, a small trio of two wild ponies and one calf. Despite their wild nature they were quite docile and did not seem to mind our presence in the slightest. We took in our fill and continued forwards.
      At one point we reached a storm shelter which distracted me enough that I accidentally stepped on a small garter snake, which I felt quite bad about. However it slithered away quickly afterwards which hopefully was a good sign.
      At this point we were around 3 miles in and could see the final stretch to the wooded summit. We pushed onwards and traveled up through the dense ponderosa forest.
      As we reached closer to the summit, it was clear that many of the trees were dead or dying, either due to the wind or insect invasion. It was hard to say. But many of them lay fallen across the trail making for a few awkward moves around them.
      Finally we started to reach near the end of the trail and the summit, though you would hardly be able to tell without the map. The summit was densely wooded making you unable to see the surrounding landscape, but thankfully at least providing a break from the wind.
      The only indication was a pair of small USGS markers hammered into two rocks claiming to be the highest points each. We stopped at both and had a few snacks and water while taking in the somewhat underwhelming summit.
      There were a few other people we chatted with briefly but we eventually had our fill and began the journey down.
      Only a short distance from the summit Har heard a large cracking sound and we looked to see one of the trees snapping at the base and falling over, thankfully not in our direction over the path. We hurried along the path out of the potential fall zone and returned back to the campground area.
      Beyond this however we were slowed once again by the same trip of ponies, lazily strolling down the path ahead of us. Since we didn't want to startle them or get kicked, we walked a distance behind them, waiting until they reached a clearing where we could pass them.
      Despite only being mere feet away they still showed little interest in us. The remainder of the trek was relatively uneventful, back through the tunnel and the highlands, taking the shortcut and arriving back at the car around 3 and a half hours in total.
      We began our drive back to Roanoke which continued to be a series of uneventful drives down windy forested roads. Eventually we arrived back and stopped again at Hars relatives, receiving a quick dinner before heading back to the hotel and getting a night rest, preparing for the next highpoints ahead.
