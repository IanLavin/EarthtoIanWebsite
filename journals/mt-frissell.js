      After leaving from New Jersey we headed up to the next highpoint of Connecticut. This one was a bit unique, as I had actually been very close to this highpoint before when staying at my aunt's house in upstate New York. 
      As we drove up the countryside, I was on the lookout for anything that seemed familiar. I was then hit with shock when I realized we were passing through the town of Stanford, where my family had been many times. 
      I could recognize the antique store, the grocery store, and more as we passed by. We then passed next to Bash Bish falls where I had gone back in 2021 before all of this had started. But finally after traveling down a small gravel road we arrived at the trailhead. 
      The odd thing was that the trailhead was on the border of Connecticut and Massachusetts and the trail frequently wandered back and forth between the two. The trail was short, only a bit over two miles; the first third or so was flat and easy. 
      Things however started to get a bit more interesting once some incline was added and sections of scrambling appeared. It was nothing crazy, at most just middle of the road class 2 terrain, but was made slightly more difficult with the thick canopy of fallen leaves covering the ground. 
      They would cause you to slip and slide as you hiked and would probably become a much more serious problem when wet. So far however, the weather was holding out and we were determined to finish before that changed. 
      We soon reached the top of what turned out to be a false summit and realized we had to drop down and do another uphill push to the true summit. With only a moderate amount of effort required, we soon arrived at the top. 
      It was quite heavily forested with thick groves of trees blocking any greater views of the surrounding areas. We located the summit register and were able to sign our names and get photos of what little views were available to us.
      We could feel the wind starting to pick up however and decided it was best not to push our luck with the weather and descended back down as soon as possible. That descent was slow and uneventful, just requiring careful footing to make sure not to slip on the widespread leaf ground cover. 
      Without much fanfare, we finally returned back to the car as once again the first trickle of rain was beginning to start. We hopped back in and set off for our third stop of the day at the highpoint of Massachusetts.
