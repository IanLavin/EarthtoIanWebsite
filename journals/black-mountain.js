      To start off the trip, Har and I departed from Phoenix for a late overnight flight to Washington DC. After getting about 3 hours of sleep, we arrived in DC around 7 am and got our rental car for a 90 min drive to Shenandoah National Park.
      The park was decent overall, it was very lush and green from recent rains which unfortunately also meant that the main trail of dark hollow falls was washed out. However we still managed to stop by the visitor center and hit the second backup trail of rose river falls.
      It was a relatively short easy trail, mostly a canyon down a few hundred feet leading to a modest waterfall around 20 feet or so tall. We had to wait about 10 minutes for this group before us to take the same selfie about 20 times but eventually got our photos and left.
      After returning to the car we traveled along skyline drive, a decent scenic winding road through the mountains that mostly led to us feeling very sleepy. We stopped briefly at a tunnel with a mini runoff waterfall but we were so exhausted we just kept going.
      Eventually I passed out in the car for about two hours and awoke to rain pouring down upon us on the edge of entering West Virginia. The landscape was very green and hilly with low hanging rolling clouds all passing by.
      After a few diversions down small backroad towns we finally reached our second destination of the day, New River Gorge. This is the current newest national park and consists of a large bridge spanning a deep canyon.
      We did our customary stamp and passport routine before taking the short trail to the bridge overlook. It was cool to see the bridge from a low dramatic angle but the most interesting part was honestly the gentle clouds emanating from the transpiring clouds in the canyon below. 
      The sky above us hung grey but with bits of sunlight breaking through the blanket above. After getting our fill, we walked back up and drove over to a second trail called the endless wall trail. 
      It was a fairly flat moderate trail through the woods, mostly accentuated by the occasional puddles of mud from the earlier day's rain. We couldn't see much for a long time, save for a small bridge over a freshly running creek. 
      Eventually we arrived at diamond point overlooking the endless wall. It was a decent overlook, with a smooth rock wall stretching out one direction and the winding canyon river in the other. 
      We sat upon a large smooth rock at the lookout for a bit, and having gotten our fill eventually retracted our steps back to the car. After another 2 and a half hour drive we arrived at our destination for the night, Roanoke Virginia. 
      Hars relatives had provided us with a free hotel stay and we met up with them briefly for dinner. Finally it was off to bed and resting before the next busy day.

      We awoke early in the morning and gathered our things before heading out back to Har’s relatives house. There they provided us with a brief breakfast before we had to head out at 8am for our first destination of the day, Black Mountain.
      It was a three and a half hour drive to Kentucky, mostly consisting of long winding roads through the woods. As we reached closer we passed through multiple small mining towns with old somewhat abandoned architecture.
      Finally we reached the turnoff to drive up to the border between Virginia and Kentucky and started on our way. One problem however, the road was littered with the fallen trees from the previous night's storm.
      Thankfully they did not impede us, however as we navigated up the windy road we had to make sure to be careful to avoid large branches and trunks across the lanes. We finally reached near the top of the gap and saw the turnoff to black mountain.
      There were a number of cars parked around the entrance but none seemed to want to brave the unpaved road. Undeterred, I started driving up the gravel road, passing downed branches and puddles of mud.
      The road was never too bad, nearly any SUV could likely make it to the end, with only a slight bit of courage required. Eventually we reached a set of radio towers and parked the car to walk the final 0.1 miles and stretch.
      The top was mostly unremarkable,  a thicket of trees surrounded the summit cutting off all views, and the radio equipment detracted from the wild feeling of the area.
      There was at least a nice small plaque detailing the highpoint which was appreciated, as well as a slew of clouds rushing by only a hundred feet or so above. After taking in our fill of the views we finally returned to the car and set out for the second highpoint of the day, Mt Rogers.
