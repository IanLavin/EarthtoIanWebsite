      For almost this entire year my goal had been to climb Mt. Whitney. I applied for a permit back in February and was awarded my 24 hour date of July 20th. I'd trained for months on a variety of different hikes.
      When the 19th finally arrived I set out early at 6am from Phoenix. I made a stop at Joshua Tree before arriving at the Whitney campsite around 5pm. After scoping out the trail a bit, I ate a quick dinner and fell asleep by 7:30PM.
      I woke up at 1:15 am and packed my things. I arrived at the trailhead by 2 and spent 15 mins sitting on a rock looking up at the milky way and a shooting star. Finally I began my trek. It was pitch black and the only light I had came from my headlamp.
      I took the old whitney trail to avoid the deep water crossing near the first mile. I continued to travel up numerous switchbacks and it was relatively uneventful. I was a bit scared about possible wildlife but thankfully I saw none.
      After dozens of switchbacks I began to come upon multiple water crossings. The first was a long log bridge series, while the rest I had to hop rocks over. I managed to mostly avoid getting wet. At this point I got a bit lost from the trail and did some off trail scrambling up rocks.
      At about 11,000 feet the snow truly began. I was feeling tired, but put on my microspikes and steadily began to climb. The first rays of light began over the horizon as I reached consultation lake and then I could finally see the infamous chute.
      I pushed forward and reached the base of the trail camp around 5am. The chute looked long and steep and was intimidating so I took a 30 min break and watched the sun rise. It was beautiful seeing the alpenglow on the needles.
      I strapped on my crampons and took out my ice axe to begin the climb. Almost immediately my right crampon came loose, a bad sign of what was to come. I fixed it and began my climb. It was slow and steady, like a sketchy stairmaster.
      I passed a few people on the way up and eventually trail crest was in sight. About 50 feet away however, my right crampon fell off. Cursing, I balanced and managed to grab it beneath me.
      It was far too steep to put it back on so I resolved to climb the remainder with just a left crampon and axe. After a very sketchy final push I reached trail crest. The view was gorgeous and I'd made good time at about 6:40 AM.
      After collecting my thoughts and scoping out my way down I began the final two mile push. It was slow going as I was really feeling the altitude. I met this group of guys from California who I hiked much of this remaining part with.
      We passed the windows which gave a cool view 2000 feet below. Finally the end goal was in sight and we had to choose between another snowfield climb or scrambling up rocks to the summit. I chose scrambling and it was much better staying on dry land.
      Finally at almost exactly 8:30 AM the summit hut came into view. I reached the summit and took lots of photos and videos. The views were outstanding with snowy peaks on all sides. There were about 15 other people up there as well and one guy brought in a yoga mat to do yoga on.
      After signing the logbook and hanging out for about an hour, I began my trek down. The scramble was easy and getting to trail crest didn't present too much of a challenge. Eventually I reached the top of the chute and it was time to face my fears.
      There was probably a four foot deep chute carved into the snow but it looked steep like 50 degrees. I opted instead to climb down some rocks to the right. It was still a steep slide but using my ice axe I dug deep and kept myself going really slow.
      I did slide over a rock and hit a batch of ice which was scary and scraped up my right calf but I regained control. Near the bottom I let up and slid a bit more freely to trail camp.
      I filtered some water from the lake and after saying bye to the people I met, continued on my way down. It was pretty easy going, however I did get lost once and had to refind the trail.
      I also encountered a ranger who checked my permits. Finally tho I reached the last section of the old trail, reaching back where I started at 2:06 PM. It was a long challenging, beautiful,scary day and I am very glad I was able to accomplish it.
