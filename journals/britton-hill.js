      For the Florida highpoint, there was very little surrounding it that was worth going out of the way to see, save for one thing, New Orleans. 
      As such, it made the most sense to visit the city for a weekend trip with a day set aside for checking this highpoint off the list. 
      So that is exactly what we did. I set off on a Thursday evening from Phoenix and flew into New Orleans late that night. 
      The following day we hit a variety of different sights around the city such as the Sazerac House, Bourbon Street, and even were able to catch an early parade a few weeks before Mardi Gras would occur. 
      But finally on Saturday we woke up early to begin our drive. We stopped and filled up on some local beignets to fuel us for the drive ahead. 
      It wasn’t an absurdly long drive, just a bit over four hours each way, but the scenery through Mississippi and Alabama wasn't the most exciting thing in the world.
       Along the way we stopped at a Buc-ee’s as it was my first time experiencing one. Finally however we crossed into Florida and left the main interstate to follow a small road to the ultimate destination, Britton hill. 
       As we pulled into the small parking lot off the side of the road there was only one other car present, yet no one in sight. The point itself consisted of a small park with a sign and stone marker commemorating the spot. 
       Interestingly enough it also had a playground with a few swings as well. We took the customary photos and videos and then for fun decided to swing on the swings for a bit. 
       I got a little idea from this and decided I had not truly reached the top of Florida until I climbed on top of the roof of the playset. It only took a few simple moves but soon I had reached it and now stood upon the true highest point of the state. 
       Having been now satisfied with this accomplishment we hopped back in the car and set off. On the way back we decided to make a small detour down to Pensacola beach to hopefully see some pretty water. 
       As we pulled up to the beach there was almost no one there and it was exceedingly obvious why this was. Wind gusts of nearly 40mph on top of temperatures barely above 35 degrees made for exceedingly poor beach weather. 
       Despite this we were still able to go down and touch the water which was nice. It was very blue and clear and would have been lovely for swimming on any other day. We took in our fill while freezing before rushing back to the car and setting off for the final drive back to the city. 
       The remainder of the trip was enjoyable with us seeing and experiencing the sights of the city. Overall this highpoint is one that was far from challenging or convenient, yet with work it can be made into an interesting enjoyable experience.
